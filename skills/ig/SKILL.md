# IG: Instagram Content Engine

Full-lifecycle Instagram management: hooks, Reels, Stories, Carousels, captions,
affiliate content, performance analysis, competitor research, editorial planning,
and content repurposing. Optimized for the 2026 Instagram algorithm with
watch time, DM-sends, and saves as primary distribution signals.

Works for any Instagram account and niche. Detects account context from API data
and adapts content strategy, hook patterns, and scoring calibration accordingly.

| `/ig caption <topic>` | Write an optimized caption (500+ chars, save CTA) |
| `/ig story <topic>` | Plan a Story sequence (slides, stickers, polls) |
| `/ig carousel <topic>` | Plan a Carousel (cover hook, slides, CTA) |
| `/ig analyze [post-url]` | Analyze post performance via Instagram API |
| `/ig audit` | Full content audit with parallel subagent delegation |

| `/ig comment` | Comment response strategy and automation |
| `/ig repurpose <post>` | Repurpose IG content for other platforms |

## Orchestration Logic

### Command Routing

1. Parse the user's command to determine the sub-skill
2. If no sub-command given, ask which action they need
3. Route to the appropriate sub-skill:
   - `reel` / `skript` / `video` -> `ig-reel` (full Reel production)
   - `hook` / `opening` -> `ig-hook` (hook generation and scoring)
   - `caption` / `beschreibung` / `text` -> `ig-caption` (caption writing)
   - `story` / `stories` -> `ig-story` (Story sequence planning)
   - `carousel` / `karussell` / `slides` -> `ig-carousel` (Carousel planning)
   - `analyze` / `analyse` / `performance` / `insights` -> `ig-analyze` (API-driven analysis)
   - `audit` / `check` / `health` -> `ig-audit` (full content audit with subagents)
   - `competitor` / `konkurrenz` / `research` / `spy` -> `ig-competitor` (competitor research)
   - `calendar` / `plan` / `kalender` / `schedule` -> `ig-calendar` (editorial calendar)
   - `strategy` / `strategie` / `positioning` -> `ig-strategy` (positioning and content mix)
   - `affiliate` / `werbung` / `kooperation` / `sponsored` -> `ig-affiliate` (compliant partner content)
   - `comment` / `kommentar` / `replies` -> `ig-comment` (comment response)
   - `repurpose` / `redistribute` / `cross-post` -> `ig-repurpose` (cross-platform repurposing)

### Niche Detection

Detect account niche from bio, content patterns, and hashtag analysis:

| Signal | Niche | Adaptation |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Workout demos, exercise names, body part focus | Fitness | Correction hooks, body-part targeting, safe exercise form |
| Recipe posts, nutrition tips, meal prep | Food / Nutrition | Recipe format templates, ingredient lists, macro data |
| Product reviews, tutorials, before/after | Beauty / Skincare | Transformation hooks, product comparison carousels |
| Tips, frameworks, income proof | Business / Coaching | Authority hooks, case study carousels, lead magnet CTAs |
| Lessons, how-to, step-by-step | Education | Curiosity gap hooks, carousel-heavy strategy |
| Day-in-life, travel, personal stories | Lifestyle | Identity trigger hooks, story-heavy strategy |
| Mixed / unclear | Creator | Analyze top 10 posts to determine primary content type |

Adapt hook library selection, caption voice, CTA strategy, and content mix
recommendations based on detected niche. If the user has configured
`references/account-baseline.md`, use that data instead of detecting.

### Algorithm Priority (2026)

Every piece of content is optimized in this priority order:

| Priority | Signal | Weight | Why |
|----------|--------|--------|-----|
| 1 | Watch Time | Highest | First 3 seconds determine distribution. Completion rate is king. |
| 2 | DM-Sends per Reach | 3-5x likes | Primary signal for reaching new audiences via Explore |
| 3 | Saves | ~3x likes | Signal for lasting value, drives Explore and Suggested placement |
| 4 | Likes/Comments | Lowest | Weakest signals; comments without saves = algorithm ignores |
| 5 | Originality Score | Gate | Recycled formats tank reach; always adapt through creator's unique lens |

## Quality Gates

Hard rules. Content that violates any gate is blocked from delivery:

| # | Gate | Threshold |
|---|------|-----------|
| G1 | Score before delivery | NEVER deliver content without a Content Quality Score |
| G2 | Em dashes | NEVER use em dashes (U+2014) in any output |
| G3 | Affiliate disclosure | NEVER create affiliate content without proper disclosure at caption TOP |
| G4 | Controversial opinions | NEVER recommend controversial opinion posts (high comments, zero saves) |
| G5 | Affiliate spacing | NEVER place 2 affiliate posts on consecutive days |
| G6 | Metrics guessing | NEVER guess account metrics; use API data or state data is unavailable |
| G7 | Safe zones | NEVER place text in format-specific unsafe zones (check format-specs.md) |

## Scoring Methodology

### Content Quality Score (0-100)

5-category weighted scoring from `references/scoring-system.md`:

| Category | Weight | What it measures |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Hook Strength | 25 pts | Curiosity gap, pattern interrupt, identity trigger, first 3s clarity |
| Content Quality | 25 pts | Value density, structure, problem-solution flow, voice authenticity |
| Caption & CTA | 20 pts | Length (500+ chars), save/DM CTA, hook variation opener, hashtag quality |
| Format Compliance | 15 pts | Correct specs, safe zones, thumbnail, duration targets |
| Algorithm Signals | 15 pts | Save/DM optimization, originality, non-controversial, watch time design |

### Scoring Bands

| Score | Grade | Rating | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| 90-100 | A | Publish | Ready to post, flagship content |
| 80-89 | B | Strong | Minor polish, ready for publication |
| 60-79 | C | OK | Targeted improvements needed (must include fix instructions) |
| 40-59 | D | Below Standard | Significant rework required |
| < 40 | F | Reject | Fundamental issues, start over |

Content scoring below 80 MUST include specific revision instructions per
deficient category. Do not just deliver the score.

### Priority Levels (for audit findings)

- **Critical**: Content violates a Quality Gate (fix immediately)
- **High**: Score < 60, significant performance drag (fix before posting)
- **Medium**: Score 60-79, optimization opportunity (improve within week)
- **Low**: Minor polish, best practice (backlog)

## Reference Files

Load on-demand as needed. NEVER load all references at startup.

**Path resolution:** All references at `~/.claude/skills/ig/references/`.
Sub-skills referencing `references/*.md` resolve to this path.

| Reference | Content | Used by |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `references/algorithm-2026.md` | Algorithm signals, ranking factors, distribution mechanics | All sub-skills |
| `references/format-specs.md` | Technical specs per format (Reel, Story, Carousel, Feed) with safe zones | ig-reel, ig-story, ig-carousel |
| `references/scoring-system.md` | Full 5-category scoring rubric with sub-criteria and severity multipliers | All content sub-skills, ig-audit |
| `references/hook-library.md` | 50+ hook templates in 5 categories with scoring and adaptation rules | ig-hook, ig-reel, ig-carousel |
| `references/content-rules.md` | Caption structure, CTA hierarchy, hashtag strategy, voice guidelines | ig-caption, ig-reel, ig-story |
| `references/account-baseline.md` | Account metrics template, API integration, KPI tracking methodology | ig-analyze, ig-strategy, ig-calendar |
| `references/affiliate-compliance.md` | Disclosure requirements, partner management, scheduling rules | ig-affiliate |
| `references/conversion-pipeline.md` | DM automation, link tracking, funnel architecture | ig-caption, ig-strategy |

## Agents

For parallel analysis during `/ig audit`:

| Agent | Role | Tools |
|-------|------|-------|
| `ig-content` | Content quality assessment across recent posts | Read, Grep, Glob |
| `ig-engagement` | Engagement pattern analysis (saves, shares, DMs) | Read, Bash |
| `ig-creative` | Visual and format compliance check | Read, Grep |
| `ig-growth` | Follower growth, reach trends, posting frequency | Read, Bash |
| `ig-competitor` | Competitor benchmarking and gap analysis | Read, WebSearch, WebFetch |
| `ig-compliance` | Affiliate disclosure, safe zones, Quality Gate checks | Read, Grep, Glob |

### Agent Details

**ig-content**: Spawned as subagent during `/ig audit`. Reads recent posts,
scores each against the 5-category rubric, identifies patterns in top/bottom
performers. Outputs: per-post scores, category averages, content mix analysis.

**ig-engagement**: Analyzes engagement metrics from API data. Calculates save
rates, DM-send rates, completion rates. Identifies which hook categories and
content types drive the highest engagement. Outputs: engagement heatmap,
best/worst performers by signal type.

**ig-creative**: Checks format compliance across recent posts. Validates safe
zones, duration targets, thumbnail quality. Flags posts violating format-specs.md.
Outputs: compliance checklist, violation list, format distribution.

**ig-growth**: Tracks follower growth rate, reach trends, posting frequency
impact. Correlates posting schedule with performance. Outputs: growth metrics,
optimal posting frequency and timing.

**ig-competitor**: Compares account metrics against niche benchmarks. Identifies
content gaps (topics competitors cover that account doesn't). Spots trending
formats and hook patterns. Outputs: competitive positioning, actionable gaps.

**ig-compliance**: Checks affiliate posts for proper disclosure, validates
Quality Gate adherence across all recent content. Outputs: compliance report,
violation flags with post references.

## Execution Flow

Standard execution order for `/ig reel`:

1. **Parse**: Identify topic, detect content type and niche context
2. **Load References**: format-specs.md + hook-library.md + content-rules.md
3. **Hook**: Generate 3 hook variants from different categories, score each, select best
4. **Script**: Structure body (problem -> solution -> insight) with segment timing
5. **Caption**: Write 500+ char caption with save CTA and niche hashtags
6. **Thumbnail**: Describe thumbnail concept with text overlay
7. **Score**: Apply full 5-category Content Quality Score
8. **Deliver**: Output complete package with score and revision notes

For `/ig analyze`, steps 1-2 run, then API calls replace steps 3-7 with data analysis.
For `/ig audit`, all 6 agents spawn in parallel, results aggregate into unified report.

## Instagram API Integration

### Graph API (Direct)

For accounts with API access configured, use the Instagram Graph API:

```
Base URL: https://graph.instagram.com/v21.0/
Auth: access_token parameter (Long-Lived User Token)
Rate Limit: 200 calls/hour per user token

Endpoints:
  GET /{user-id}?fields=id,username,media_count,followers_count,follows_count
  GET /{user-id}/media?fields=id,caption,media_type,timestamp,like_count,comments_count&limit=50
  GET /{media-id}/insights?metric=reach,saved,shares,likes,comments,total_interactions,ig_reels_avg_watch_time
  GET /{user-id}/insights?metric=reach,follower_count,total_interactions&period=days_28
```

Note: `plays` and `impressions` are NOT supported in current API version.

### Token Management

Store tokens in environment variables, never in reference files:
```bash
# In .env or shell profile
export INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-token-here"
export INSTAGRAM_USER_ID="your-user-id"
```

### Graceful Degradation

If API access is not configured or token is expired:
1. Inform the user that live data is unavailable
2. Fall back to data in `references/account-baseline.md` (if populated)
3. Clearly mark any analysis as "based on cached data, not live"
4. Never fabricate metrics

## Setup: Account Configuration

After installation, configure for your account:

1. **Populate account-baseline.md** with your account metrics:
   - Run `/ig analyze` to pull live data via API
   - Or manually enter: followers, avg engagement, top posts, posting schedule
2. **Set API credentials** in your `.env` file
3. **Customize hook-library.md** with hooks that work in your niche
4. **Run `/ig audit`** to establish your baseline scores

The skill works without configuration (using general best practices), but
performs significantly better with account-specific data.

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do These)

| Anti-Pattern | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| Deliver without score | Incomplete deliverable; score is mandatory |
| Use em dashes | #1 signal of AI-generated text |
| Generic hashtags (#fitness, #motivation) | Zero distribution value, signals low effort |
| Controversial opinion posts | High comments, zero saves = algorithm ignores |
| Copy competitor hooks verbatim | Originality Score (2026) penalizes recycled formats |
| Guess metrics | Stale data leads to wrong decisions; use API or state uncertainty |
| Skip format-specs.md | Wrong specs = reduced reach (safe zones, duration, ratio) |
| Affiliate without disclosure | Legal violation in most jurisdictions |
| Optimize for likes over saves | Likes are the weakest algorithm signal |
| Wall-of-text captions | Line breaks mandatory for readability and retention |
| Post at the same time every day | Algorithm rewards variation within optimal windows |
